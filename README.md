Research at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and philosophy.  
This repository explores how **arithmetic structure gives rise to geometry, dynamics, and physical constants**, without fitting, stochastic assumptions, or hidden parameters.

> If it cannot be derived or measured, it is not assumed.

## 🔭 Focus Areas

- Cyclotomic fields and the operator \( J = 1 + \zeta_5^2 \)
- Golden‑ratio contraction and scale generation
- Fibonacci interference and discrete wave structure
- Pentagonal and icosahedral geometry (A₅ symmetry)
- TWIST physics — spacetime as a mechanical substrate
- Geometry as physics, not as decoration

## 🧭 J‑TWIST Canon — Messenger

**Script:** `scripts/j_twist_messenger.py`

The **Messenger** is the current core artifact of this repository.

It is **not a simulation** and **not a numerical fit**.  
It is a **deterministic derivation chain** starting from a single axiom:



\[
J = 1 + \zeta_5^2 \quad \text{with} \quad \zeta_5 = e^{2\pi i/5}
\]



From this axiom, the script defines — step by step and with internal consistency locks:

- the golden‑ratio backbone and regulator,
- geometric capacity and slip parameters,
- the fine‑structure constant,
- electroweak mixing (tree level plus correction),
- selected lepton and baryon mass ratios,
- a dimensionless gravitational coupling mapped to SI,
- cosmological fractions and thermodynamic scales.

All relations are explicit.  
All identities are asserted at runtime.  
No parameters are tuned.

The Messenger defines **what the Canon claims**.

### ▶️ Run the Messenger

    python scripts/j_twist_messenger.py

Running the script prints a structured report:
axioms → derivation chain → asserted identities → comparison table → falsifiability criteria.

## 📊 Comparison with Experiment

The Messenger compares derived quantities against:

- **NIST / CODATA 2022** reference values for  
  \(\alpha^{-1}\), \(m_p/m_e\), \(m_\mu/m_e\), \(m_\tau/m_e\), \(G\), and electron mass anchors.
- **PDG 2024 Electroweak Review** for the quoted \(\sin^2\theta_W\) reference value.

Both **relative error** and **sigma deviation** are printed explicitly.  
For very precisely measured ratios, ppm‑level deviations correspond to large‑sigma tensions; this is shown, not hidden.

---

## ⚖️ Inputs and Anchors

- The core derivation chain is **dimensionless**.
- The electron mass \(m_e\) is used **only as a unit anchor** to express some results in SI / MeV.
- The Z‑boson mass \(M_Z\) appears **only in the optional “Extended Predictions” block**.

No parameters are fitted to experiment.

---

## 🔍 Uniqueness Claim (Model‑Internal)

The Messenger includes a constrained comparison over Platonic \(\{p,q\}\) solids under the model’s extension rules.

Within this restricted family and rule‑set, only the icosahedral case \(\{3,5\}\) reproduces sub‑ppb agreement for \(\alpha^{-1}\) together with ppm‑level agreement for \(m_p/m_e\).

This is a **model‑internal uniqueness result**, not a general mathematical theorem.

---

## 🧪 Dynamics and Simulation (Deferred)

A separate simulation layer studies what happens when the Canon is **observed through a finite‑memory measurement channel**, leading to distinct regimes (ERA I → ERA II → ERA III).

Simulation code exists but is **intentionally secondary** at this stage.  
The current focus is on establishing the Canon as a stable, auditable reference.

---

## ❌ Falsifiability

The Messenger states explicit failure conditions (“kill shots”), including:

- electroweak mixing outside the stated window,
- a non‑zero photon mass,
- discovery of a fourth sequential fermion generation.

If any of these occur, the model is falsified.

## ✨ About

I write about the hidden architecture of number systems, the geometry of the golden ratio, and the way contraction, rotation, and symmetry give rise to the experience of time. My work blends mathematical clarity with philosophical curiosity, aiming to reveal how simple algebraic seeds can generate complex physical behavior.
