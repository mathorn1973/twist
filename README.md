Research at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and philosophy.  
I explore how arithmetic structures generate dynamics, time, and form — from cyclotomic geometry and golden‑ratio contraction to Fibonacci interference and discrete mechanical models of spacetime.

## 🔭 Focus Areas

- **Cyclotomic fields** and the operator \( J = 1 + \omega_5^2 \)  
- **Golden‑ratio dynamics** and contraction‑based time  
- **Fibonacci waves** and Binet‑type interference  
- **Penrose tilings**, pentagonal symmetry, and 5D projections  
- **TWIST physics** — spacetime as a mechanical substrate  
- **Geometry as physics**, Pythagorean structure, emergent form

## ✨ About

I write about the hidden architecture of number systems, the geometry of the golden ratio, and the way contraction, rotation, and symmetry give rise to the experience of time. My work blends mathematical clarity with philosophical curiosity, aiming to reveal how simple algebraic seeds can generate complex physical behavior.
