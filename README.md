Research at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and philosophy.  
I explore how arithmetic structures generate dynamics, time, and form — from cyclotomic geometry and golden‑ratio contraction to Fibonacci interference and discrete mechanical models of spacetime.

## 🔭 Focus Areas

- **Cyclotomic fields** and the operator \( J = 1 + \omega_5^2 \)  
- **Golden‑ratio dynamics** and contraction‑based time  
- **Fibonacci waves** and Binet‑type interference  
- **Penrose tilings**, pentagonal symmetry, and 5D projections  
- **TWIST physics** — spacetime as a mechanical substrate  
- **Geometry as physics**, Pythagorean structure, emergent form

## 🧪 J‑TWIST Messenger  
**Soubor:** `scripts/j_twist_messenger.py`

This script implements a numerical exploration of a **geometric ansatz** built on:

- the golden ratio \(\varphi\),  
- the cyclotomic unit \(J = 1 + \zeta_5^2\),  
- and several derived dimensionless quantities.

It computes:

- an effective fine‑structure–like constant,  
- a geometric audit (“gap”) between pure ratios and reference values,  
- a WEP‑like κ parameter,  
- and, when `mpmath` is available, a dilogarithmic parity test.

The code is designed as a **reproducible numerical probe** of the TWIST ansatz and a starting point for further analysis.

### ▶️ Run it with:

```bash
python scripts/j_twist_messenger.py

## ✨ About

I write about the hidden architecture of number systems, the geometry of the golden ratio, and the way contraction, rotation, and symmetry give rise to the experience of time. My work blends mathematical clarity with philosophical curiosity, aiming to reveal how simple algebraic seeds can generate complex physical behavior.
